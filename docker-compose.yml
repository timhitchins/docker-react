    # this is dealt with by:
    build:

    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
      # this is how to deal with volumes
      # to replace this long ass command:
      # docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app b6a66800139a
    volumes:
      # node_modules was deleted to keep the build from being long
      # so this say don't map back to the local directory

      # aka the local folder which is .
      - .:/app
  #     a semi solution service is to create a new container
  # we wabt to set everything the same except ports
  # the other option is to do a docker exec -it 155bf3793ea7 npm run test
